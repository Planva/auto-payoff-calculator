                <h2>Interest Rate</h2>
                <p>The interest rate is the percentage charged by a lender on the borrowed amount of your auto loan. It determines how much extra you’ll pay on top of the loan principal over time, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR).</p>

                <h2>Loan Term</h2>
                <p>The loan term is the length of time you have to repay your auto loan, usually measured in months. A longer loan term means lower monthly payments but higher total interest, while a shorter term reduces interest but increases monthly payments.</p>
